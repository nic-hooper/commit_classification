__label__extract process both orderings dvd and airthis is in service of issue let s look at a few episodes of the show robot chicken i refer to season and episode number information like s e as a placement episode title dvd placement aired placement western hay batch s e s e triple hot dog s e s e joel hurwitz returns s e s e hopefully salt none s e yogurt in a bag none s e so if a user has a file robot chicken s e mp and the renaming rule says we should add the episode title to the filename which title should we add our answer as of now is it should be the former simply because we have a blanket policy of prefer dvd ordering so if we prefer dvd ordering should we look only at dvd placement no some shows simply don t have any dvd information not every show gets released on dvd but beyond that many shows as the robot chicken example shows have released some episodes on dvd but not others what if we see robot chicken s e mp we still prefer dvd ordering but there is no episode with s e as its dvd placement but there is one with s e as its regular placement so we use that one we prefer an episode that matches the season and episode number in its dvd ordering but we will fall back on the over the air placement if no episode meets the criteria we implement this by building an index previously the process was we iterate over all known episodes if it has a dvd placement we try adding it to the index at that place if it doesn t have dvd placement we try using the over the air placementso western hay batch would be entered into the index using its dvd placement s e since yogurt in a bag doesn t have a dvd placement it would be entered at s e we would try to add joel hurwitz returns to the index at s e it s dvd placement as for hopefully salt we would try to add it to the index using its aired placement s e so there s a conflict the behavior as of the previous release was we d panic log a message about the two conflicting episodes and put neither of them into the index note that such a conflict only happens when two episodes have the same preferred placement which only happens if one of them has a dvd placement and the other one doesn t it does not happen every time that the dvd placement disagrees with the over the air placement for example western hay batch and triple hot dog both could be mapped to s e but s e is not the preferred placement for triple hot dog so there was no conflict this commit introduces a class episodeoptions now a placement is mapped to an instance of episodeoptions rather than just to a single episode now when we iterate over every episode in show we always add both placements to the index dvd and over the air we don t reserve over the air for a fallback any more and we remember which placement is which because the episodeoptions class preserves this information then when we look up an episode in a season we say whether we prefer the dvd ordering or air ordering there is always a fallback when doing a get you will get the ordering you asked for if such an episode is there but will get one from the other ordering if your requested ordering doesn t have an episode as of now in the application we only get with a dvd preference but that may change in a future commit we are already able to get non dvd episodes in the test harness so going back to our example this ensures a deterministic answer for s e it will be the dvd s e because that s currently the preference this also ensures a deterministic answer for s e it will be the air s e because no dvd s e exists we now have functionality to extract hopefully salt as s e it just isn t yet exposed to the userthe code would allow the same episode to be the only episode mapped at two different places in the index it also would allow multiple episodes with the same placement even with the same ordering neither of these things should ever happen but the code doesn t check for it and is prepared to handle it if that s the data we get from the provider

__label__inline remove the need for explicit row locks when allocating uids the existing code with explicit row locks exhibited very poor performance and also prevented multiple tsds from allocating uids concurrently the new approach consists in performing an atomic increment to grab a new uid cas ing compareandset the reverse mapping uid name cas ing the forward mapping name uid if we die after step we waste an uid if we die after step we just end up with an orphaned reverse mapping harmless when two tsds race to assign a uid to the same name one of them will fail to cas the forward mapping at step and will retry to find the uid assigned by the winning tsd when that occurs the only net consequence is that a uid will have been wasted by the losing tsd whereas the previous implementation wouldn t waste one when this happened the uid fsck command can easily detect orphaned or wasted uids and we could conceivably put them on some kind of a free list in the future to re allocate them if two tsds are running side by side and one uses the old method while the other uses the new lock less method things still work as expected there are two possible scenarios old tsd goes first locks the maxid row and does its thing the new tsd will have to wait until the row lock is released for its atomic increment to go through the new tsd goes first atomically increments the maxid row and does its thing the second tsd locks the maxid row and proceeds to allocate its own id concurrently

__label__inline massive refactoring to exception handling i m trying to simplify things but they are currently a little bit more complicated i ll do another round shortly the main benefit of this change is that now all of our error handling flows through one class errors java it takes care of managing the current source line managing the current injectionpoint building messages tostrings because of this refactoring we now use almost exactly the same code for both provisionexception and creationexception the consequence of this is that provisionexceptions now include a full error report all of the classes injected fail fast but not too fast now applies to provide time as well as injector create time i also made injectionpoint into a public class in spi it replaces dependency i like this change because dependency is a very abstract name whereas injectionpoint is very guicey guice injects stuff dependencies are a consequence of this but i like the api better exposing the core guice abstractions directly this entire change needs further doc simplification and cleanup todo git svn id guice googlecode com svn trunk d f a b b b d aecad e

__label__inline do work inside getmovetopath previously fileepisode had two methods a private one called getmovetodirectory which composed a string from the user specified destination directory replacement template and the information we ve found about the file and a public one caleld getmovetopath which basically called getmovetodirectory and turned the result into a path this made some sense since we work with strings a lot all the various components are strings and we need a string to put into the resultstable still the point ultimately is to move the file so the actual path is pretty important plus using path resolve seems better than concatenating strings with file separator string we still need the strings but switch it around create the path object and use tostring to get the string version

__label__push-down extracted a very unecessary dependency on java util uri this is probably the bigest change ever refactored on the system the uri class was nested deep into the system for no real reason it was assumed that all backends would have a uri scheme and that we keep the uri at all times on all buckets this was not the case and everything from the bucket model to the pathresolver had to be refactored the change was made in the first place because glacier does not have a uri that we can just call instead we want to configure each backend with key values instead of with uri s this change to the system should also make it easier to transition into a key value store since the abstraction for transfering buckets is give this bucket this key and when i give you the key again then give me back my bucket

__label__move attached is a patch that does the following improves performance of commit rollback by reducing number of round trips to the server uses functionality for setting the transaction isolation level backs out a patch from days ago because that code failed to compile under jdk details the old code was doing the following for each commit commit begin set transaction isolation level xxx thus a call to commit was performing three round trips to the database the new code does this in one round trip as commit begin set transaction isolation level xxx in a simple test program that performs transactions where each transaction does one simple select inside that transaction has the following before and after timings client and server on same machine old new sec sec improvement client and server on different machines old new sec sec improvement all timings are an average of four different runs the driver was using set transaction isolation level xxx at the begining of each transaction instead of using the new syntax of set session characteristics as transaction isolation level xxx which only needs to be done once instead of for each transaction this is done conditionally i e if server is or older do the old behaviour else do the new behaviour to not break backward compatibility this also required the movement of some code to check test database version numbers from the databasemetadata object to the connection object finally while testing i discovered that the code that was checked in days ago actually didn t compile the code in the patch for connection setcatalog used properties setproperty which only exists in jdk or higher thus compiling the jdbc driver failed as this method doesn t exist thus i backed out that patch barry lind

__label__move eliminate inner class from showname querystring previously was a static inner class in showname move its functionality up to showname i guess the whole distinction was kind of a dumb idea here s the dumb idea if we get two files like the office s e mp the office s e mkv i was thinking we should have separate showname objects for each because the substrings we extract as the found show names are not identical the office the office however their query strings are identical so that s what the previous setup did had them have separate showname objects while sharing a querystring object i realized that was pretty pointless i do still think it s important to retain the actual found show if something goes wrong with the office s e mp we don t want to say we had a problem parsing the office because that string does not even appear in the filename so we do maintain the original untouched string but we maintain it in fileepisode for the work we re doing here we don t need to retain it especially since as i was reminded in a recent commit the whole point is to not process both shownames since they have the same query string we only need to process one of them that s why we had the query string in the first place so to say either the office or the office failed is wrong anyway it s really the query string that failed if we do mention one or the other it s only as an example of a filename that gave us this problem so we do still keep an example found name along with the query string but we don t need separate show names which means we d have a to mapping between shownames and querystrings which means they can just be the same object

__label__inline combine two methods into getreplacementtext previously fileepisode had getnewfilename which would construct a new filename out of downloaded information if in fact that information was successfully obtained the method would return various other pieces of text in the case where we didn t yet have sufficient information then we had getnewfilepath which took the result of getnewfilename and if move was enabled prepended the destination directory getnewfilename was useful as a public function in two places when we first create the table item we assume we won t yet have have the file information so we called getnewfilename to get the placeholder text and then registered a listener to change it when we had the information in the fileepisodetest we want to validate the name without the destination directory getting in the way is solved by simply having the placeholder texts be returned by the combined method was already solved by always disabling move for those tests the returned text will never have the directory prepended as far as a name goes neither getnewfilename nor getnewfilepath were really accurate since it could very well return a different type of text so i m settling on getreplacementtext possibly that name could still be improved

__label__inline node analyze can now replace the current ast node this is needed for cases where the parser does not know better and creates the wrong type of ast nodes this submit looks much bigger than it is because almost every class implements node adding the replacement node as a return value of analyze touched many classes but the changes are minimal in most cases this is returned i e the node is not replaced the first and so far only example of actually replacing the node is a qualifiedide that is mistaken for a dotexpr since they cannot be distinguished syntactically only after parsing the imports the compiler can detect that a dotexpr is indeed a qualifiedide transforming the ast has to keep all symbols including their white space it then makes it easier to analyze other expressions e g to detect non invoking access to static members of other classes which have to be initialized before accessing the member warning i was too lazy to always reassign child nodes with the result of node analyze because i know that currently only dotexprs may be replaced this is a todo because it may lead to surprises in case the same technique is used for other nodes in the future git p depot paths coremedia jangaroo change

__label__extract even more performance issues fixed i do not guarantee there are no bugs in this build status of what else needs to be done will be assessed later on what has changed if every protection is inside of the cache it is safe to assume that any block not in the cache is not in the database we leverage this fact heavily in this build to give a significant boost to performance caches cache all the computations numerous caches have been added in various places where specific points of bad performance was located at these caches generally only store computationally expensive calls overall this is also significant after the caches are nice and toasty modules before lwc s own module system would broadcast events to every registered module this added a overhead of about k nanoseconds per module if they didn t override the method this has been changed to detect at runtime what methods they have overrided and then only send events to modules that have them overridden we could have modules register what events they use but this would break backwards compatibility with plugins that hook into lwc this uses reflection but is all done on startup so the overhead is minimal the gains is fairly large and worthwhile there is still a potential to shave off even more precious cpu cycles but this will be assessed further once initial results are in for scope here is some example values for events timing is in nanoseconds event before after redstone k k interact k k

__label__inline purge references to block ids from most of the code block ids are going away in minecraft each block should be referenced by its name why block ids will of course still be used internally in the save files and network packets but to the outside world they re gone in the future minecraft will use dynamic ids everywhere grass doens t have to be id it could as well be id at the moment all vanilla blocks still have a static id mods on the other hand already use dynamic ids forge takes care of that when registering a block in forge it is unknown to the modder which id the block will get up until this commit terrain control still used block ids everywhere in the code this maked it a hassle for users of terrain control to find out what the id was of a modded block from now on modded blocks can just be referenced by their name breakdown most instances of int id int data have been replaced by localmaterialdata material localmaterialdata holds both the block and its data localmaterialdata is immutable so it can be easily shared to other classes localmaterialdata has two methods to create a new instance with different block data withblockdata data to change the block data to something else and rotate to automatically rotate the block data rotate uses the blockhelper class to achieve this as the local in the name suggests localmaterialdata is implemented by the bukkit and forge versions of terrain control you can use terraincontrol readmaterial string or terraincontrol tolocalmaterialdata defaultmaterial int blockdata a new class called materialset has been added this class replaces the various block list implementations we have seen so far in terrain control all block lists now have consistent behaviour you can now for example use solid or all in the sourceblocks in the resources of the biomeconfigs and in the blockchecks in bo s previously this was only possible in spawnonblocktype in bo s materialset will get a few improvements soon to let it work better with block data some places in the code still use the byte id arrays i m not sure at the moment what should happen with them however the ids in those arrays are dynamic now old configs ids in old configs will still be read defaultmaterial getmaterial int id continues to provide a block id lookup for the vanilla blocks even when all ids become dynamic in minecraft defaultmaterial will still use the old static ids to make sure that old worlds still load properly references html final note could anybody help testing this this commit is huge and i would be surprised if it didn t break at least four things

__label__inline motivation currently the messageconsumer end handler is called only when consumer is unregistered during an event bus close when the consumer is explicitly unregistered it is not called this handler is mainly used by rxjava and kotlin coroutines and it seems it would be best to call the end handler in all case to give an opportunity to end the treatment in rxjava it would call the complete handler and in kotlin it would close the underlying channel so a for each iteration on the channel would terminate and execute the code after change call the messageconsumer end handler when the messageconsumer is unregistered explictly

__label__inline combine two methods into getreplacementtext previously fileepisode had getnewfilename which would construct a new filename out of downloaded information if in fact that information was successfully obtained the method would return various other pieces of text in the case where we didn t yet have sufficient information then we had getnewfilepath which took the result of getnewfilename and if move was enabled prepended the destination directory getnewfilename was useful as a public function in two places when we first create the table item we assume we won t yet have have the file information so we called getnewfilename to get the placeholder text and then registered a listener to change it when we had the information in the fileepisodetest we want to validate the name without the destination directory getting in the way is solved by simply having the placeholder texts be returned by the combined method was already solved by always disabling move for those tests the returned text will never have the directory prepended as far as a name goes neither getnewfilename nor getnewfilepath were really accurate since it could very well return a different type of text so i m settling on getreplacementtext possibly that name could still be improved

__label__extract rewrite substitution resolver use explicit immutable resolvesource the immediate motivation here was to fix which this does but in this commit a couple of existing test cases are broken in a way which seems to relate to order of resolution and resolve memoization so we need to layer on to this commit better solutions for caching and cycle detection to get rid of yet more mutable state the previous setup used a side effect based lookup table of replacement values to conceptually modify the tree without actually modifying it unfortunately that setup was hacky and hard to reason about and apparently broken in cases such as this new setup actually creates a modified tree and passes it around explicitly instead of inside resolvecontext in this commit resolvecontext still unfortunately has a mutable cache and a mutable table of cycle markers both of those in theory could also be replaced by simply modifying the tree the main downside to this commit and to cleaning up the remaining mutable state is that we re using java collections which have to be copied wholesale for every mutation they are not persistent functional data structures this will have an unknown performance impact though in a sane world config resolve is not a bottleneck in anyone s production app some other details of this commit resolve concerns removed from peekpath in abstractconfigobject and relocated into resolvesource recursive resolution removed from lookupsubst and moved to configreference new hasdescendant method used only in debug tracing it is grossly inefficient to ever call this full tree traversal new replacechild method is inefficient due to java collections but could in theory be made efficient most complexity relates to always knowing the parent of a node that we might have to replace so we can walk up replacing it in its ancestor chain todo in subsequent commits fix failing test cases we cannot replacechild if we are a descendant of configconcatenation but we probably need to be able to consider fix this instead of memoizing resolve results in a hash table just continuously modify the resolvesource to have the most recent results instead of using the cycle markers table change the configreference to a cycle detector value

__label__move adding domainroot causes split in core plus additional refactorings in this commit many files got moved around see below for details on some decisions and features already ported to the new version of the framework abstract support for backend each back end must implement the pt ist fenixframework core backend interface and typically to provide a subclass of config that supports setting it up appropriately closes closes it was a design decision that the domainroot dr should be a part of the fenix framework core core given that the dr must be modelled in dml then the core must run the dml compiler thus the dml compiler must be moved out of the core because of how maven dependencies work this is accomplished in a new module fenix framework dml compiler dml compiler this module also gets the domainobject do the abstractdomainobject ado and the default pojocodegenerator pcj any code generator should generate domain classes that inherit directly or not from ado any concretization of a domain model requires the implementation of the getexternalid and getoid methods from do and ado respectively now the core depends on the dml maven plugin which implies that code used by the plugin must be moved out of the core namely the project and dmlfile classes this led to the creation of the fenix framework project module on which the dml maven plugin now depends besides depending on the dml compiler of course additionally because the core also contains the atomic annotation this was also extracted and moved to the dml compiler actually it makes sense for the dml compiler to be able to post process domain classes inject special constructor and process atomic annotations closes the persistent root module was later renamed to domain root and even later it was decided to include the dr in the core the well known id of the root object is hardcoded and hidden in each back end through the implementation of getdomainroot the core provides a default configuration with a default in memory only back end thus it must provide a concrete implementation of getexternalid and getoid for the dos it uses a corecoregenerator ccg that simply extends the pcj to set the domain class root to be the pt ist fenixframework core coredomainobject class because the ccg is used by the dml maven plugin which in turn runs before the main compilation phase the ccg must be made available in another module this is done in fenix framework core code generator regarding issue the ant task is now on dml compiler but still needs to be moved out of there to a separate module closes the transactional interface is not finished but when the need for more changes arises a new issue should be created moreover jcarvalho is looking into this in issue summary of dependencies between fenix framework modules fenix framework dml compiler none fenix framework project none dml maven plugin fenix framework core code generator fenix framework core not yet but will be added later via the plugin

__label__inline provide a better support of the revision labels and a details history between them this is a squashed merge of a refactoring done for respecting the attached files added by the user at the same time numerous speed improvement was done to enable a faster importation by doing less interaction with the starteam server if built from the fake starteam speed is increased by a lot it should be on par if you did build against the starteamsdk provide a means to get the file from history by view version create a fake revision labeladded revision labels to the mix of required changes create test data for testing revision labels import get rid of meaning less todo extract the creation of a commit entry from the recursive file populationthis way we can get a detailed history of the individual files to extract andrecreated a much better history properly create the file based on the view versionpotential issue where the viewversion contentversion create a commit strategy to experiment alternative to file populationthe current limitation of readability of the code for creating commits ingitimporter class is at its limits the filepopulationstrategy aim toextract the history creation of the view since the last configuration thiswill permits some simplification on the configuration of gitimporter classand provide a wider range of technique to extract the history from astarteam view implement the getviewversion for potential future use provide a version of a file based on a label id properly return null if the item is not attach to the label move deletion composition and rename finding into basepopulationstrategy moved the rename the filepopulationstrategy retab some old modified functions remove some dead code add verbosity to the base strategy properly build the path and fix other bug found making the tests re enable cleanup of repository after an execution of import add a test for the base file populationthis is to make sure that there isn t any regression added for the creationof the list of commits make sure the shareto is executed before the update make sure we don t ever get cached objects added a means of querying the last files the strategy has seen clarify the condition and reformat for understandability optimize the overuse of pathname and improve testing of ischild increase test to be closer to real potential use rename class to have a better logic to it added the base integration of the commit strategy cache the tostring return value for increased performance finalize rename of classes and use contentversion instead of viewversion correct the misleading property names starteamsdk documentation isn t consistent with itself which lead to thesekind of errors added revision strategy which is only a base strategy for now correct a bad assumption regarding history orderthe history shall be from the newest version to the oldest inform the commit strategy about the current labeland at the same time get check if we need to make a tag associated with thislabel properly initialize the strategy for change request correct the move operation and name the commit accordingly use the commit strategy in the git importerand fix the test regarding the new behavior correct a move operation badly detected correct problem where openjdk oraclejdk use char sequence instead of string directly replace the join with a more primitive version prevent back and forth for information we already knowand at the same time remove some dead code do not enforce the missing build date tokenfallback to the label revision time instead if user only want a set ofbuild label he will need to apply a proper filter to not select someoperationnal label provide a better explanaison of the reason we are selecting those fields extract the method which process a single file this is to actually override it label in the revisionpopulationstrategy some other strategy may be better to select all the files but the simplestfor now is to simply iterate recursively through all files and only selectthose that are attached to the requested labels correct bad logic regarding deleted files added basic test for revision labels strategy promote debug logs to verbose implement support from specific revision label support create the view with the right time move set of the earliest time from gitimporter to the base strategy simplify more the changerequest commit filter correct the computation of the time of the commit correction add some more test for the implementation of the revision labels implement the revision labels management and importation comment log relating a label with only some files implement a label exclusion to rule out some misleading revisions use proper javadoc syntax add missing header in new files cache all change request prior to starting the import put the initial version in its own variable such modification will enable to retreive all the files version from thestarteam repository but with a good chance of weird effect it is betterto keep for now as the renames or move operations won t be correctlyreflected make sure to only poke getviewversion onceit does seem to make a round trip to the server which slow down theconversion process add somekind of progress bar provide a retry mechanism for fetching items versions if somebody does a commit at the same time we do make fetching of the versionsof a files we may end up crashing we try to protect from this crash asfrom the server add missing import add more resiliance when no change request availables correct comment and casing of the members disconnect once we are finished with the import make less interaction with the starteam server

__label__move jcbc improve writability of integration tests motivation when writing an integration test case that has special requirements like a dedicated bucket avoid the flush phase use a different bucket name it has become very difficult to rely on inheritance of clusterdependenttest base class as junit doesn t behave very well with abstract parent classes there was a need for a different more flexible approach modifications most of the code mutualized in clusterdependenttest has been moved into a couchbasttestcontext class this context holds the references to the cluster bucket bucketmanager etc it also provides utility methods to perfom assertions on the context eg is n ql available and lifecycle management cluster disconnect such a context should be created in a beforeclass method on each test case instead of it extending clusterdependenttest by using the couchbasetestcontext builder builder clusterdependenttest has been made deprecated and is mirroring the old behavior by relying on couchbasetestcontext internally thanks to that tests that were previously ignored have been reactivated results using the couchbasetestcontext with the associated builder allows for far more flexible integration tests for example it is possible to set a specific bucket name then to have it being created in an adhoc way by appending a timestamp to the given name so that it can be destroyed after the testcase change id ibf a ec d fa f ca bf cd bc reviewed on tested by simon basl√© reviewed by michael nitschinger

__label__inline remove the need for explicit row locks when allocating uids the existing code with explicit row locks exhibited very poor performance and also prevented multiple tsds from allocating uids concurrently the new approach consists in performing an atomic increment to grab a new uid cas ing compareandset the reverse mapping uid name cas ing the forward mapping name uid if we die after step we waste an uid if we die after step we just end up with an orphaned reverse mapping harmless when two tsds race to assign a uid to the same name one of them will fail to cas the forward mapping at step and will retry to find the uid assigned by the winning tsd when that occurs the only net consequence is that a uid will have been wasted by the losing tsd whereas the previous implementation wouldn t waste one when this happened the uid fsck command can easily detect orphaned or wasted uids and we could conceivably put them on some kind of a free list in the future to re allocate them if two tsds are running side by side and one uses the old method while the other uses the new lock less method things still work as expected there are two possible scenarios old tsd goes first locks the maxid row and does its thing the new tsd will have to wait until the row lock is released for its atomic increment to go through the new tsd goes first atomically increments the maxid row and does its thing the second tsd locks the maxid row and proceeds to allocate its own id concurrently

__label__inline rewrite substitution resolver use explicit immutable resolvesource the immediate motivation here was to fix which this does but in this commit a couple of existing test cases are broken in a way which seems to relate to order of resolution and resolve memoization so we need to layer on to this commit better solutions for caching and cycle detection to get rid of yet more mutable state the previous setup used a side effect based lookup table of replacement values to conceptually modify the tree without actually modifying it unfortunately that setup was hacky and hard to reason about and apparently broken in cases such as this new setup actually creates a modified tree and passes it around explicitly instead of inside resolvecontext in this commit resolvecontext still unfortunately has a mutable cache and a mutable table of cycle markers both of those in theory could also be replaced by simply modifying the tree the main downside to this commit and to cleaning up the remaining mutable state is that we re using java collections which have to be copied wholesale for every mutation they are not persistent functional data structures this will have an unknown performance impact though in a sane world config resolve is not a bottleneck in anyone s production app some other details of this commit resolve concerns removed from peekpath in abstractconfigobject and relocated into resolvesource recursive resolution removed from lookupsubst and moved to configreference new hasdescendant method used only in debug tracing it is grossly inefficient to ever call this full tree traversal new replacechild method is inefficient due to java collections but could in theory be made efficient most complexity relates to always knowing the parent of a node that we might have to replace so we can walk up replacing it in its ancestor chain todo in subsequent commits fix failing test cases we cannot replacechild if we are a descendant of configconcatenation but we probably need to be able to consider fix this instead of memoizing resolve results in a hash table just continuously modify the resolvesource to have the most recent results instead of using the cycle markers table change the configreference to a cycle detector value
