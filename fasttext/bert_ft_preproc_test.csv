indexupdater fix when a record changes so that a different rule from the indexerconf matches a different set of vtags might become active in such case deletes must be done on solr to remove the entries corresponding to the old vtags for the indexupdater to be able to do this it needs to know what rule matched before hence it needs both the old new record state this is exactly the same as what we need for evaluating the indexrecordfilter in the indexawaremqfeeder and is put into recordevent by indexselectionrecordupdatehook therefore the information provided by this hook is now also useful for indexupdater additionally for update of denormalized data to work records which are not indexed by themselves but are accessed through dereference expressions also need to be matched by the indexrecordfilter to be able to express this we need to support include rules with empty vtags this basically says include the record but don t index it the same could be achieved by rules to exclude the record from indexing but that s more expensive the recordfilter decision can be made without even loading the record and currently doesn t help much with dynamic fields either solving all this brought a couple of other changes with it refactored vtaggedrecord moved out things which only dependend on recordevent and not on a loaded record into recordeventhelper probably could use further refactoring to completely split the two because now vtaggedrecord is also used in cases where there is no recordevent and then maybe reintroduce a third party to combine them indexer integration dropped merged it with engine due to circular dependencies for their tests engine test now needed the indexrecordfilterhook could have been solved also by splitting indexer integration into two different projects but decided that it s ok to have it together with engine renamed recordevent indexselection to recordevent indexrecordfilterdata renamed indexselectionrecordupdatehook to indexrecordfilterhook fixed npe in indexrecordfilterhook in case of a record update where no record type is specified pulled out the code to create record s from the information stored in recordevent into a new utility class indexrecordfilterutil so that it can be reused by indexupdater indexertest now needs an indexrecordfilterhook which depends on indexermodel which was previously not used in this test,move
jcbc join nest key clause uses on keys syntax motivation in n ql the correct syntax for a on keys clause in a nest or join is on keys expression not keys expression as currently implemented also there s a clause that uses keys keyword but differently when referencing primary keys document ids the use keys syntax should be used this syntax expects strings or array of strings not a token could be implemented as a usekeys method next to the current keys methods modifications keyselement now takes an enum to denote the type of keys clause keyspath keys methods for the join side of things have been renamed to onkeys added usekeys for the from side of things referencing a primary key onkeys and usekeys accept an array of strings usekeys with array of size will only produce a string in query not a json array refactored unit tests where on keys was expected modified unit tests where use keys what meant instead of on keys results all unit tests passing one can now do a from clause on the primary key using usekeys methods the syntax for joins key clause has been fixed in onkeys methods change id i da c b c afe fb dd dcd reviewed on tested by simon baslé reviewed by michael nitschinger,rename
